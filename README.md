## Introduction

Pong is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle, trying to hit the ball past their opponent's paddle. The game keeps track of each player's score, and the first player to reach a certain score wins.

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of Pong using Python's Turtle graphics library. It includes paddles, a bouncing ball, score tracking, and speed increases as the game progresses.

## How to Play

- Use the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys to control the right paddle.
- For the left paddle, use the "W" key to move up and the "S" key to move down.
- The game starts with the ball in the center, and the player who first misses the ball gives a point to their opponent.
- The ball's speed increases each time it hits a paddle, making the game more challenging.
- The game continues until you decide to exit the window.

## Features

- Classic Pong gameplay with two paddles and a bouncing ball.
- Scoreboard to keep track of the scores for both players.
- Ball speed increases after each bounce on a paddle.
- Responsive paddle controls using arrow keys and "W" and "S" keys.
